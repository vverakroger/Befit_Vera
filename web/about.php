				<h2>Lose weight for FREE with BeFit!</h2>
				<p>Losing weight is not easy, we know that, but with a BeFit membership, you will get the tools you need to lose weight successfully, and maintain it. The best thing is that everything on our site is 100% FREE. Forget your credit card, you will never have to pay a penny.
				</p>
				<p>
				Studies after studies have confirmed the benefits of keeping track of what you eat and the activities you do. It's simple - the more consistent you are in keeping track of your food, the more likely you are to lose weight. That is why every successful weight control program suggests that you keep a record of meals and / or activities. But tracking everything you eat without the right tools can be tedious, at least, or simply impossible.
				</p>
				<p>
				At BeFit, we focus on making sure you register your meals as easily and quickly as possible. Because the easier it is for you, the more likely you are to stay on track and succeed in your weight loss goals!

				<h2>How does it work?</h2>
							<p>
				The reason why our system is so easy to use is because it learns from you! We all tend to eat the same foods over time,
				<br>
				BeFit remembers what you have eaten and the activities you've done in the past, and it makes it easier for you to add those foods back to your registry.
				<br>
				The more you track your meals, the easier it is to keep doing it in the future.
